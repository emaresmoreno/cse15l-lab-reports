<h1>Week 6 Lab Report 3</h1>
<h3>Streamlining ssh Configuration </h3>
<p>If done correctly streaminglining ssh configurations seems like a clear and organized way to create a short cut
 into entering the ieng6 server. Creting a file where one can directly see what is being added lets you more easily catch any errors (most likely spelling errors)
 when creating it.

<h3>Settingup Github Access from ieng6 </h3>
<p>This seems a little harder as you need both a public and a private key. However working with github and knowing where they are stored'
 and how to create one seemed more straight to the point.

<h3>Copy whole directories with scp -r</h3>
<p> This option does not need for you to go to a different website or page which makes it a little less complicated. The complicated part is 
  correctly copying the whole directory.
